## FAQ

#### How do I add new projects?

You can add, import and export projects using the menu in the top left. Here you can also add new link groups, links and tasks.

#### Can I share my project?

Projects are synced between your devices. But you can not share it with anyone else. You can export the project to another computer but any changed made there will not be synchronised.
